Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program.

To declare a variable, you need to use the \`=\` operator. The \`=\` operator assigns a value to a variable.

- **Name**: The Name is the name of the variable.

Here is an example of how to declare a variable:

~~~
Name = "Melon Musk"

In this example, the variable Name is assigned the value "Melon Musk".
